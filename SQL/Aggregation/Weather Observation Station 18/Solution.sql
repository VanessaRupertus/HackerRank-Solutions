Consider P1(a, b) and P2(c, d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.
